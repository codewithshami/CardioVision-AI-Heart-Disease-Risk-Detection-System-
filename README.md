Project Title
HEART DISEASE RISK DETECTION
(CARDIOVISION AI)
Domain
Healthcare (Heart Disease Prediction using AI/ML)
Problem Statement
CardioVision AI addresses the critical gap in early heart disease detection by leveraging machine learning to analyze patient demographics and clinical parameters, accurately predicting individual risk and enabling timely clinical intervention.
Project Description
CardioVision AI is an end-to-end machine-learning system that ingests routine clinical and demographic data (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG readings, lifestyle) to train and validate a predictive model—tested via cross-validation on public and partner datasets—and exposes a Dockerized REST API plus simple web UI for clinicians to input patient metrics and receive an explainable heart-disease risk score, enabling faster, more consistent early intervention.
Scope of the Work
The scope of work encompasses acquiring and preprocessing anonymized clinical and demographic data; engineering predictive features; training, tuning, and validating heart-disease risk models; building a Dockerized REST API and clinician-facing web UI with explainability; and conducting a pilot validation with real-world clinical partners.
Project Modules
•           Data Preparation: collect, clean and transform clinical & demographic data into features.
•          Modeling: train, tune and evaluate explainable ML classifiers for risk prediction.
•          Deployment: package the chosen model in a Dockerized REST API and clinician web UI.
•          Validation: run a pilot study with healthcare partners to test accuracy and usability.
•          Documentation & Training: produce technical/user guides and train end users.

Implementation Methodology
Step 1: Data collection and preprocessing.
 
Step 2: Model training with ML algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost,).
 
Step 3: Model evaluation and tuning.
 
Step 4: Deploy model to web application for easy access.

Advantages of this Project

       • Fast and automated heart risk detection.
• Reduces manual errors.
• Aids doctors for better and early decision-making.
• Scalable and easy to integrate with hospitals or clinics.
            •          Early Risk Detection: Flags high‐risk patients before symptoms manifest
                        enabling proactive care.

	•	Improved Accuracy: Leverages ensemble and explainable ML techniques to  
                        outperform traditional screening methods.

	•	Time & Cost Efficiency: Automates data analysis and risk scoring, reducing 
                  clinician workload and minimizing unnecessary tests.

	•	Explainability: Provides feature‐importance insights (e.g., via SHAP) so 
                 clinicians understand the “why” behind each prediction.

	•	Scalability & Portability: Dockerized design allows rapid deployment across 
                  hospital servers or cloud platforms.

	•	Standardization: Delivers consistent risk assessments, reducing variability in 
                 clinical decision-making.

	•	Data-Driven Decisions: Integrates diverse patient metrics into a single risk score, 
                 supporting evidence-based interventions.

	•	Easy Integration: REST API and lightweight web UI streamline adoption within 
                 existing.
